The pkg-kolab team using git-buildpackage (gbp) [0] for their deployment.

Additionally we have following rules:
* master is the branch for sid
* using pristine-tar / upstream branch -> so importing ala:
gbp import-orig ../libkolab_<VERSION>.orig.tar.gz --pristine-tar
* the changelog entry for a new upstream has debian revision -0 version 
  and distribution UNRELEASED
* changelog is not updated with every patch; gbp dch is used instead.
* the debian tag should only be uploaded, if the package was successfully 
  uploaded to debian repository (mail from Debian queue daemon)
